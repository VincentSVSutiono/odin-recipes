    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This delicious flat iron steak was created from a combination of different recipes that I read. I combined, adjusted, and finally perfected the marinade and cooking time to my taste. I'm sure you will love it as well. After all, it is perfection!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Iron Steak</li>
        <li>Spice & Pepper</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place steak in the hot skillet and discard any remaining marinade; sear and cook steak for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
        <li>Allow steak to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
